# Design a full-fledged network for an organization with multiple subnets

<h1>Abstract:
<p>The goal of this project was to have a thorough understanding of how a complex 
mesh of networks functions. This project also provided me with insight into how a 
sophisticated network architecture can be implemented in practice. Computer 
Network Is a collection of computers and other devices. When you're linked to the 
internet, you can communicate. sharing of information and equipment in a network 
This is a multi-dimensional network. The network design I presented should ideally 
meet all of the requirements and be as near to a real-world implementation as 
possible.</p>
